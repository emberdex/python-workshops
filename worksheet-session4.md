# Intro to Python

## Lesson 4

### What will we cover?

In this session, we'll cover:

- Fundamentals of HTML and CSS
- Serving static content from your Flask server
- Creating configuration files

### Getting started with Python
If you've already managed to get Python working on your computer, you can skip this.

To follow these instructions, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as a text editor if you're on Mac or Linux (we recommend Visual Studio Code).

**If you're on Windows:**
- Press Start, and look for a program called IDLE. Open it - you'll get a white window with some text in it.
- At the top, click File > New - you'll get another window, where you'll type your code in.
- Save this empty file somewhere, making sure the name of the file has .py at the end of it.
- ~~To run your code, press F5 on your keyboard, or click Run > Run Module.~~
- If you're trying to run Flask code, running it in IDLE won't work because of a bug with IDLE. You can continue to edit in IDLE, but if you want to run your code, find where you saved it and double-click the file. It should open in a black Command Prompt window instead.

**If you're on a Mac or Linux**
- Open Visual Studio Code, and create a new file by clicking File > New.
- Save this empty file somewhere, making sure the name of the file has .py at the end of it.
- You might be prompted to install the 'Python' extension - do so, and click Reload when it finishes. Visual Studio Code will restart.
- To run your code, in the menu bar, click Debug > Start Without Debugging. A window will appear at the bottom of Visual Studio Code with your code's output in it.

This lesson is a continuation of Lesson 3, so it's important to have followed it from start to finish as we'll use some of those files. If you missed lesson 3, you can find the guide [here.](http://hacksoc.net/python-3)

If you have trouble with any of this, feel free to ask a mentor for help!
